  <h1>Australia Weather </h1>
  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; max-width:800px; margin:14px auto; color:#2e2c84;">
  Australia’s weather is diverse due to its vast size and varied geography. 
  The northern regions experience a tropical climate with hot, humid summers and heavy rainfall, 
  while the south enjoys a temperate climate with cooler winters. 
  Central Australia is mostly arid or semi-arid, featuring extreme temperatures and low precipitation. 
  This diversity results in distinct seasonal patterns across states and territories.
  </p>
  <h2>Average Temp by Country</h2>

  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; max-width:800px; margin:14px auto; color:#2e2c84;">
  The map illustrates the average temperature across countries worldwide. Regions near the equator, 
  such as central Africa and Southeast Asia, experience the highest temperatures, shown in deep red. In contrast, 
  areas closer to the poles, like northern Europe and Canada, are much cooler, shown in light orange and yellow shades. 
  Australia appears in moderate orange tones, indicating a generally mild and warm climate — not as hot as equatorial regions, 
  yet considerably warmer than temperate zones like Europe. This reflects Australia’s balanced weather pattern, 
  influenced by its large land area and diverse geography.

  <h2>Average Max Temperature by State</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div id="vis2" class="vis chart"></div>
  <div class="aside">
    <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px">Key takeaways</h3>
    <p>
      Average max temperatures across states sit mostly between <b>20–30 °C</b>.
      The Northern Territory is warmest, while VIC/TAS/ACT are milder.
      Overall Australia is warm but not extremely hot, especially in coastal areas.
    </p>

  <h2>Average Min Temperature by State</h2>
  <div class="row">
  <div id="vis3" class="vis chart"></div>
  <div class="aside">
    <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px">Key takeaways</h3>
    <p>
      Average minimum temperatures across states sit mostly between
  <b>6–19 °C</b>. Queensland and the Northern Territory have the
  warmest nights, while <b>TAS/ACT</b> are the coolest.
  Overall, nights are generally mild in the major coastal states, but
  become noticeably cooler in the south and inland during winter.
    </p>

  <h2>Average Temp Difference</h2>
  <div class="row">
  <div id="vis4" class="vis chart"></div>
  <div class="aside">
    <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px">Key takeaways</h3>
    <p>
      The Northern Territory (NT) shows the largest temperature difference,
      In contrast, coastal and southern regions such as Tasmania (TAS) and Queensland (QLD) show smaller differences.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

  <h2>Average Daily Rainfall by State </h2>
  <div class="row">
  <div id="vis5" class="vis chart"></div>
  <div class="aside">
    <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px">Key takeaways</h3>
    <p>
      Northern regions such as the Northern Territory (NT) and Queensland (QLD) receive higher amounts of rainfall. This abundant precipitation 
      supports agriculture, tropical vegetation, and water resources, but it can also lead to flooding risks and health issues 
      related to humid conditions.
      In contrast, southern and inland regions such as South Australia (SA), Victoria (VIC), and Western Australia (WA)
      experience lower rainfall and a much drier climate. While this can be suitable for outdoor activities and sun exposure, 
      drought and water shortages can increase the likelihood of natural hazards such as bushfires.
